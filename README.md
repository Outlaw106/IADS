## IADS tips:

### INSTALLATION:
 Load at mission start in mission editor using Trigger> 4 Mission Start > Do Script File (this file)

 No naming required.
 
 Works on red coalition ground units for now.
 
 SAMs within 80km of an EWR are considered controlled, will only turn on when a blue air unit is in the air within ranges specified at the top of the file
 
 Uncontrolled SAMs will blink on and off
 
 HARMs and other ARMs detected by EWRs and SAMs have a chance of causing defensive behaviour in the SAM sites
 
 TORs remain on
 
### Mission Designer tips:
 Don't mix EWR and SAM sites in one group
 
 Don't mix SAM types in one group
